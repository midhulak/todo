1. I have designed Simple Todo App based on CodePath Tutorial reference.

I have done the following things in Todo App

1.Simple Todo Screen I have created ListItems of size 6.
2. Added 1 button in the bottom to add the new Item.
3.When You do longclick on Item it will delete the item from the list.
4.After Every transaction I did I'm saving it into the file and retriving from the file when I load the screen.
5.Created 1 more screen to Edit the Item.
6.After I edit the item I'm setting it back to the same position in the list and saving it in file.


I'm very new to Android this is my first Application but basically I'm Java Developer So It is very easy for me to understand.
